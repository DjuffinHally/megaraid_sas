Out-of-tree megaraid_sas driver version 7.x.y.z for GNU/Linux Debian Stretch and Jessie.

As of Feb. 12th 2018, the megacli_sas driver version available in Debian Stretch (Linux 4.9) does not support Dell's H740p raid controller. Neither do Jessie's (Linux 3.16) and Jessie-backports' (Linux 4.9) ones.

Dell however provides an out-of-tree version of megaraid_sas, version 07.700.52.00, for RHEL 7 and SLES 12.

This repository provides an extract of the RHEL package provided by Dell, ready to be consumed by dkms on Debian systems.

The driver files (sources) stored in this repository can be retrieved again using the fetch.sh script (not needed for building/installing).


To install the driver from sources:
$ dkms add ./dkms.conf
$ dkms build megaraid_sas/07.700.52.00
$ dkms install megaraid_sas/07.700.52.00

To build the binary driver deb package:
$ dkms mkbmdeb megaraid_sas/07.700.52.00

To build the dkms deb package:
$ ./dkms mkdeb megaraid_sas/07.700.52.00
(Needs to use the ./dkms script provided in this repository to fix a bug with the mkdeb command, see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=832558)


The following line can be added to a Debian source.list file, in order to provide the generated deb packages stored in this repository:

   deb [trusted=yes] https://github.com/npf/megaraid_sas/raw/master/debian /


Also the modules directory provides the modules .ko files for a direct use, e.g. in the Debian installer possibly using

   d-i partman/early_command string wget "https://github.com/npf/megaraid_sas/raw/master/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/dkms/megaraid_sas.ko" && insmod megaraid_sas.ko

as a directive in a preseed file (see: https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/example-preseed.txt) [not tested yet]
